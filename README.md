# RCamera v2

RCamera is an old project I have created to be able to watch my cameras on-line that used the outdated Adobe Flash Player. It lacks proper documentation and can get messy in a few places, therefore in case of update/extension, documenting before is an important to-do :D.
All the front-end text is in Hungarian.
